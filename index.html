      <hr />
      <section class="tulsividyamandir">
        Tulsi Vidyamandir is located in Nana Bhadiya which is a small village in
        the south eastern part of the Mandvi taluka of Gujarat. Previously this
        area had very little or no access to Secondary and Higher Secondary
        education and the children there had to travel to the nearby town for
        their schooling purpose. Established in 2005, Tulsi Vidya Mandir not
        only provided the students with the infrastructure for education but
        gleefully accepted those students who were denied admissions in other
        institutions due to poor grades. The girls from the nearby 12 villages
        who were earlier deprived of education are now getting educated from the
        school and are joining nursing, police force etc. Today, close to 550
        children study in this highly rated institution. Some of its alumni have
        been successfully joined various fields including Indian Army, Navy,
        Forest services, national sports teams etc.

                C.V Gogri was born in Kutch in 1946 and got his primary
                education in Nana Bhadiya. After managing one of the leading
                Chemical Industries in India, he wanted to ensure that every
                child in Nana Bhadiya pursues secondary education. Hence he
                started Tulsi Vidyamandir in 2005 with 57 students. He was
                inspired by the teachings of APJ Abdul Kalam and his principles
                of PURA (Providing urban amenities to rural area).

        TVM has always provided its students a platform where they can explore
        various career options. 18 of our alumni are currently in Indian army
        which is an achievement as very few people are from the Kutch region.
        Our under 17 girls kabaddi team were crowned as champions in the
        interstate under 17 kabaddi competition held in Ahmedabad. Also the
        boys’ cricket team has excelled in many domestic competitions.
